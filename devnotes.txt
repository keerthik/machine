TODO:
IMPLEMENTATION:
* Implement GitHub log-in

* Character artwork
* Item/skill classifications

LEVEL DESIGN:
* Tune the levels to different people's "playstyles" - or rather allow them to discover their preferred playstyle
* Assimilation of code - pick up nuances from existing code rather than chunks from SO/Google
* Levels that actually use the code created to solve conflict
* Badass level that involves people collaborating
